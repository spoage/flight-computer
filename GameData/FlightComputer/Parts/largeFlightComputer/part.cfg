	description = After many years of research, STEADLER Corps rocket scientists discovered that Kerbal crewmembers just can't be trusted to keep a spacecraft under control. Further more, they tend to be really bad at math, and screw up the calculations necessary to keep a spacecraft in the air. Thus was born the Advanced Flight Computer.
